# Slime Bucket

##Description
A Spigot server-side remake of the Slime Bucket from the Quark Mod, which works with a vanilla client.  Allows players to catch a small slime in a bucket, which will then become excited and hop up and down when the player is in a slime chunk.

##Information
This plugin was created exclusively for the Mumbo Jumbo Fan Server.
